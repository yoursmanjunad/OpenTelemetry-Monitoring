# OpenTelemetry Monitoring 

- Here, I had got this repository which was developed by engineers at OpenTelemetry.
- I had implemented this on my amazon ec2 instance, and monitored the Microservice application (11) built on multiple languages like C++, Java, Go, and others. 
- These are the screenshots while monitoring the application using OpenTelemetry.
